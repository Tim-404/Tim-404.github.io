# As a CS-related major
Sup.
I am a student at **UCSD** studying *Math-CS*.

I began programming in highschool in Java, but as I have used the language more and more, something about it has really annoyed me.

> Boilerplate code.

It's one of those things that make the language a drag to work with nowadays.
Like, who came up with `public static void main(String[] args)`?
About time that we moved on to a newer language.

Like the [Rust language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)!
It doesn't have the same issue of boilerplate code that Java has, and it enforces memory safety rules at compile time.

Anyways, ignore that advertisment. As an aspiring computer scientist, here is my progress:
- [x] seeing text in dark mode
- [x] learning the syntax of languages that I will never use
- [x] going to school instead of bootcamping
- [x] 
- [x] applying a lot....
- [x] getting an internship
- [x] realizing I know ... not much
- [ ] getting hired full-time
- [ ] getting laid off
- [ ] getting promoted
- [ ] fighting mid-life crisis
- [ ] retiring

# As a human...

I like to play sports, including the following:
- tennis
- ultimate frisbee
- badminton

But when I'm not doing anything else productive or spending time with friends, usually I waste the rest of my time on
1. Youtube
2. Rubik's cube
3. Minecraft

in that order :)
